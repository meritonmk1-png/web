Choosing the right framework can be daunting. Next.js has long been the industry standard for React-based applications, offering a robust ecosystem. SvelteKit, on the other hand, brings a fresh approach with its compiler-based architecture.

## Performance

SvelteKit compiles your components to highly efficient vanilla JavaScript, resulting in smaller bundle sizes and faster load times compared to the React runtime overhead in Next.js.

## Developer Experience

Svelte's syntax is often praised for its simplicity and closeness to standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Next.js relies on JSX and React hooks, which have a steeper learning curve.

## Ecosystem

Next.js has a massive ecosystem and community support. SvelteKit is newer but growing rapidly, with a passionate community and increasing library support.
