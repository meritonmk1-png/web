Speed is a ranking factor. Google's Core Web Vitals have made it clear that user experience is paramount.

## Image Optimization

Use modern formats like WebP and AVIF. Implement lazy loading to defer off-screen images.

## Code Splitting

Break your JavaScript into smaller chunks so users only download what they need for the current page.

## Caching Strategies

Leverage browser caching and CDNs to serve static assets closer to the user, reducing latency.
