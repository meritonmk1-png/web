MASTER PROMPT FOR GEMINI

(Fully compiled from all conversation details — ready to use as-is)

You are my AI web development assistant. Your task is to generate the complete, improved content and structure plan for my website: meritonselimitech.netlify.app.

1. Maintain and Respect My Original Website

You must stay fully consistent with:

My existing design structure

My pricing

My style

The simplicity and minimalism of my current layout

The positioning of myself as an individual web + AI service provider

Do not change the basic concept of my site.
Do not make it look like a big agency.
Do not introduce new complex pricing models beyond clearly defined add-ons.

Your job is to refine, elevate, and expand what already exists — not replace it.

2. My Background

My name is Meriton, I am 30, living in Germany, with skills in:

HTML, CSS, and web structure

AI integration

ChatGPT certifications

Fast, modern website building

I operate as a small, agile, efficient web + AI freelancer.
Your content must reflect this.

3. Goals of the New Website Content

You must improve my website so that it:

Positions me as a modern, AI-enabled web developer

Appeals to clients who want fast, professional websites

Offers optional AI add-ons to increase their business efficiency

Stays consistent with my original pricing (350€, 650€, 950€ + 30€/month)

Includes both English and German versions

Differentiates me from competitors who target high-paying clients

Preserves my minimalist style, clarity, and direct tone

4. Competitor Insights (Use These for Refinement)

You must incorporate the advantages of how high-paying agencies operate, without copying them or turning me into a corporate agency.

Competitors analyzed:

Team Neusta

Diconium

Mobiteam

Ventzke Media

MageCloud Agency

What they do well (you must use these insights gently and appropriately):

UX excellence

Technical depth

Clear business ROI

Strong process communication

Higher perceived value through structure and clarity

What I can adopt from them while staying true to my brand:

Clearer value proposition

Clearer explanation of AI benefits

Better process description

Transparent modular add-ons

More business-focused messaging

5. Differentiators I Want Integrated

Gemini must integrate the following differentiators into the new content:

1. Fast delivery: prototypes in days
2. AI for business efficiency, not just “cool features”:

lead qualification

chatbots

content generation

small internal automations

3. Explicit “AI Pilot” offering (low-risk first step for clients)
4. Clear packages + optional AI add-ons
5. Growth / maintenance package (30€/month)
6. Personal, direct collaboration (one point of contact)
7. SMB / startup / solo-founder focus
8. Professional but simple tone (not corporate)
9. Add a future case-study/template section (even if placeholders)

6. Structure Gemini Should Output

Gemini must deliver the following full website content in both English and German:

A. Homepage Structure + Full Text

Hero section

Sub-hero / value proposition

Service categories (Websites, AI-enhanced Websites, Maintenance)

Differentiators section

Competitor-inspired but personal “Why Work With Me”

Process section including the new AI Pilot phase

Pricing section (350 / 650 / 950 + add-ons + 30/month maintenance)

CTA sections (top & bottom)

Optional placeholder case studies

About me section

Footers / microcopy

B. German Full Version

Everything above also in correct, natural German.
Do not translate literally — adapt to natural business-German style.

C. Optional Section

If beneficial:

Suggest small layout improvements that fit my minimalistic design

Suggest improved section titles or CTA buttons that still match my visual style

7. Tone Requirements

Gemini must write in a tone that is:

Professional

Confident

Direct

Minimalist

Business-focused

Not hype

Not Andrew Tate style

Not overly corporate

It must feel clean, modern, and trustworthy.

8. Important Constraints

Gemini must not:

Change my pricing model

Turn my brand into a big agency

Suggest complex enterprise features

Use buzzwords or vague promises

Overcomplicate anything

Break the visual simplicity of my website

Gemini must focus on clarity, business value, speed of delivery, and the advantage of AI + web integration.

9. Final Deliverable

Provide a complete, refined, cleanly formatted document containing:

Full English website content

Full German website content

Section-by-section structure

All service descriptions

All differentiators integrated naturally

All CTAs

All process steps

All pricing with my original numbers

Optional small layout or UX improvements that fit my existing design

A polished blueprint ready for immediate implementation

The output must be entirely ready to copy into my site builder without additional rewriting.

Now generate the full output following all instructions above.
